# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains **well-documented solutions to competitive programming problems**, primarily from platforms like **Codeforces**.
Each problem is presented with a **clear, structured explanation** aimed at helping readers understand not just *what* the solution is, but *why* it works.

The goal of this repository is to act as a **learning resource**, especially for students, beginners, and interview candidates who want to strengthen their problem-solving skills.

## What This Repository Offers

Each problem solution is accompanied by a **professionally written explanation** that typically includes:

* Problem source and platform
* Direct link to the original problem
* Clear problem statement
* Input and output format
* Constraints
* Multiple examples with explanations
* Intuition behind the solution
* Algorithmic approach
* Step-by-step breakdown
* Visual walkthroughs for better understanding
* Time and space complexity analysis
* Fully commented source code
* Test case analysis
* Edge cases and common mistakes
* Interview relevance and learning outcomes
* Difficulty assessment

This structure ensures the repository is useful not only for solving problems, but also for **revising concepts and preparing for technical interviews**.

---

## Platforms Covered

* Codeforces
* LeetCode
* HackerEarth
* Other competitive programming platforms may be added in the future

---

## Languages Used

Solutions are written in one or more of the following languages, depending on the problem:

* Java
* C++
* (Additional languages may be included where specified)

All code is written with **readability and clarity** in mind and includes **detailed comments**.

---

## Repository Structure

A typical problem folder or file includes:

* Problem explanation in a structured markdown format
* One or more language implementations
* Clear class naming that matches the problem title
* Logical separation between explanation and code

This makes it easy to navigate and understand each solution independently.

* Compare time and space trade-offs

This workflow mirrors how problems should be approached in real interviews.

---

## Educational Focus

This repository prioritizes:

* Clarity over clever tricks
* Explanation over memorization
* Correctness and efficiency
* Professional documentation standards

It is intentionally designed to be **beginner-friendly yet interview-relevant**.

---

## Disclaimer

All problem statements belong to their respective platforms.
Solutions are provided **for educational purposes only**.
