## Problem Statement

You are given multiple test cases.
In each test case, a string is provided that represents a simple arithmetic expression of the form:

```
a+b
```

Here, `a` and `b` are **single-digit non-negative integers**, and the plus sign `'+'` is always present between them.

Your task is to compute and print the **sum of `a` and `b`** for each test case.

## Input Format

* The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.
* Each of the next `t` lines contains a string of length `3` in the format `digit + digit`.

## Output Format

For each test case, output a single integer — the result of the addition.

Each answer should be printed on a new line.

## Constraints

* `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`
* The input string length is always `3`
* `0 ≤ a, b ≤ 9`
* The input format is guaranteed to be valid

## Examples

### Example 1

Input

```
3
1+2
4+5
0+9
```

Explanation

* Test case 1: `1 + 2 = 3`
* Test case 2: `4 + 5 = 9`
* Test case 3: `0 + 9 = 9`

Output

```
3
9
9
```

### Example 2

Input

```
1
7+1
```

Explanation

* `7 + 1 = 8`

Output

```
8
```

## Approach

**Direct Character Parsing**

The solution directly accesses characters in the string and converts them into integers using ASCII manipulation.

## Intuition

Since the input format is fixed (`digit + digit`):

* The first digit is always at index `0`
* The plus sign is always at index `1`
* The second digit is always at index `2`

There is no need for expression parsing or string splitting.
Subtracting `'0'` from a numeric character converts it to its integer value.

## Algorithm Steps

* Read the number of test cases `t`.
* For each test case:

  * Read the input string `s`.
  * Convert `s[0]` and `s[2]` from characters to integers.
  * Add the two integers.
  * Print the result.

## Visual Walkthrough

### Test Case 1

Input

```
3+4
```

Character positions:

```
Index 0 → '3'
Index 1 → '+'
Index 2 → '4'
```

Conversion:

```
'3' - '0' = 3
'4' - '0' = 4
```

Result:

```
3 + 4 = 7
```

### Test Case 2

Input

```
0+5
```

Conversion:

```
0 + 5 = 5
```

---

### Test Case 3

Input

```
9+0
```

Conversion:

```
9 + 0 = 9
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

**O(1) per test case**

Each test case involves constant-time string access and arithmetic.

### Space Complexity

**O(1)**

No extra space is used beyond a few variables.

## Solution Explanation

The solution relies on the fixed input structure.
Instead of parsing the string or evaluating an expression, it directly extracts the two digits using their known positions and computes the sum efficiently.

This approach is optimal, simple, and fully aligned with the problem constraints.

## Full Solution

### C++ Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    // Number of test cases
    int t;
    cin >> t;

    // Process each test case
    while (t--) {

        // Input string in the format "a+b"
        string s;
        cin >> s;

        /*
         s[0] -> first digit character
         s[1] -> '+' character
         s[2] -> second digit character

         Subtracting '0' converts a digit character
         into its corresponding integer value
        */
        int a = s[0] - '0';
        int b = s[2] - '0';

        // Output the sum
        cout << a + b << '\n';
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Test Cases Analysis

| Test Case | Input | a | b | Output |
| --------- | ----- | - | - | ------ |
| 1         | 1+2   | 1 | 2 | 3      |
| 2         | 4+5   | 4 | 5 | 9      |
| 3         | 0+9   | 0 | 9 | 9      |
| 4         | 9+0   | 9 | 0 | 9      |

## Edge Cases to Consider

* Minimum values (`0+0`)
* Maximum values (`9+9`)
* Large number of test cases
* Repeated identical expressions

## Common Test Cases

* Small digit additions
* Zero involved in addition
* Symmetric cases like `5+5`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Treating characters as integers without subtracting `'0'`
* Attempting to parse the string unnecessarily
* Assuming multi-digit numbers (not allowed by constraints)

## Interview Relevance

* Tests understanding of character-to-integer conversion
* Reinforces fixed-format string processing
* Common warm-up problem in coding interviews

## What This Problem Teaches

* Efficient handling of fixed-format input
* ASCII-based character conversion
* Avoiding overengineering for simple tasks

## Key Takeaways

* Fixed input formats allow direct indexing
* Character arithmetic is efficient and reliable
* Always align parsing strategy with constraints
